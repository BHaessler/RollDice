# Roll Dice

A program that will roll a dice and then ask the user if they want to roll again for doubles, additives or multiples. Then will tell user if they were sucessful or not. \
\
When the user chooses to roll again, the rerolled dice will be compared to the first roll no matter what. Picking which die to compare is a functionality I hope to add later. \
\
This was developed in Visual Studio Code \
\
\
**FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS**\
\
I would also like to add a gui function that shows the face of the die rolled.
