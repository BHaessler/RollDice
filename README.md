# **Roll Dice**

A program that will roll a dice and then ask the user if they want to roll again for doubles, additives or multiples. Then will tell user if they were sucessful or not. 

When the user chooses to roll again, the rerolled dice will be compared to the first roll no matter what. Picking which die to compare is a functionality I hope to add later. 

### Developmental Environment 
This was developed in Visual Studio Code and the CLI (command line interface) as well as [programiz.com](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)'s online compiler
