# **Roll Dice**

A program that will roll a dice and then ask the user if they want to roll again for doubles, additives or multiples. Then will tell user if they were sucessful or not. 

When the user chooses to roll again, the rerolled dice will be compared to the first roll no matter what. Picking which die to compare is a functionality I hope to add later. 

### Developmental Environment 
This was developed in Visual Studio Code and the CLI (command line interface) 

## System Requirements: 
- Python3

*See all requirements in the requirements.txt file* 

### How to use this project 
1. Clone the entire repository and then enter the location where you cloned it (Details on how to do that can be found [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository "Github doc on how to clone"))
2. Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to ensure you have all the dependencies on the system you are using to run this program. 

## **FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS**

I would also like to add a GUI function that shows the face of the die rolled. This will probably be done with a Django webframe and attachments but will be a work in progress for a while.

## KNOWN BUGs
